# SCORE Network Sports Data Repository

This is the [CMU Statistics & Data
Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/) Data Repository,
a collection of datasets curated for use as course examples and assignments. See
the [published website](https://cmustatistics.github.io/data-repository/) for
the full repository. To submit a dataset, review [the
instructions](https://cmustatistics.github.io/data-repository/submit-data.html).

This website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Recent RStudio
versions can automatically render and preview Quarto files. If you have Quarto
installed, you can also preview the website by running this command in the
repository:

```sh
quarto preview
```

GitHub Actions is configured to render the website and publish it to GitHub
Pages automatically. This happens automatically within a few minutes of each
push to the `main` branch.
