## Motivation

The dataset was found via kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata)

Since the UFC is fairly recent compared to other professional sports leagues, there are less data analytics around the sport compared to other leagues. Therefore, it is important to provide interpretable analysis to gain traction in analyzing data from the UFC.
