## Motivation

The categories above determine how this dataset is listed on the [datasets by
methods](https://data.scorenetwork.org/by-statsds-topic.html) page.
Consult that page for a list of statistical categories already used by other
datasets.

In this first section, describe the source of the dataset and what it's about.
Give any necessary background about it and the sports research question of interest. See other
datasets on the website for examples.

This file is Markdown, so you *can* use formatting; [here is a guide to the
basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

## Data

Describe the data. What does each row represent? How many rows are there? If
there is missingness, say how it is coded and why it is present.

| Variable | Description |
|----|-------------|
| Column name | A description of this variable, including units when possible |
| Column name 2 | A description of this variable, including units when possible |

: [filename.csv](../data/filename.csv)

For the link above, change filename.csv to the name of the data file. Leave the
`../data/` part in the link; this is where the data will live in the system.

If there are multiple data files, repeat the table, including the line starting
with `:`, for each data file.

## Questions

If possible, list some analyses or research questions that could be answered
with this dataset, or the types of questions you'd ask students. This is mainly
meant to give other instructors ideas for how they could use the data.
