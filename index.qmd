title: "SCORE Sports Data Repository"
---

The [SCORE Network](https://scorenetwork.org/index.html) Sports Data Repository curates interesting datasets across a variety of sports for use in statistics and data science education. Each dataset has the following properties:

* A _sports question_ of interest, with context motivating why the dataset is relevant and interesting to explore.
* A _statistics / data science topic_ which the dataset can be used to help teach.
* _Example questions_ that instructors can use to help build lessons, handouts, and SCORE modules.

Datasets are organized by sport along the left, but you can also browse [by statistics and data science topic](by-statsds-topic.qmd).

This repository is heavily inspired by the [CMU S&DS Data Repository](https://cmustatistics.github.io/data-repository/).

_The development of the SCORE with Data network is funded by the National Science Foundation (award 2142705)._
