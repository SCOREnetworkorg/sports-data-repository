The SCORE Sports Data Repository curates interesting datasets across a variety of sports for use in statistics and data science education. Each dataset has the following properties:

* A _sports question_ of interest, with context motivating why the dataset is relevant and interesting to explore.
* A _statistics / data science topic_ which the dataset can be used to help teach.
* _Example questions_ that instructors can use to help build lessons, handouts, and SCORE modules.

Datasets are organized by sport along the left, but you can also browse [by statistics / data science topic](by-statsds-topic.qmd).
