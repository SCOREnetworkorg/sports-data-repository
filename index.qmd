The Data Repository curates interesting datasets for use in statistics and data
science education. Each dataset is supported by a *story* describing its origin
and application, and a set of interesting *questions* that can be answered using
the data. This means:

* Every dataset has context in a scientific field, pop culture, or daily life.
* Beyond context, datasets are interesting. They feature more than just a dozen
  observations from an antiquated scientific study â€” many feature thousands of
  observations of dozens of variables, and answer questions interesting to a
  wide audience.
* Just like in science, some datasets give null results.
* Instructors can easily build lessons and assignments from the
  suggested questions.

Datasets are organized by sport on the left, or you can browse a
list [by statistical methods used](by-method.qmd).
