## Motivation

Data for a particular sport is often stored across numerous locations. For example, in NCAA Division I Softball, batting statistics for each season are typically stored in separate tables. (See for example the statistics hosted by https://d1softball.com/)

Suppose we are interested in tracking the statistics of players across multiple seasons. A common way to prep the data to do this is to use join statements to merge each season's data into one table with one row per player (and columns associated with their different statistics for each season).

## Data

There are four data tables associated with this page.

Two of them, `batting2021` and `batting2022`, contain statistics for all Division 1 Softball player who played in the 2021 and/or 2022 season.

The other two, `batting2021_subset` and `batting2022_subset`, represent non-random samples taken the full data and can be used to manually illustrate how to merge the tables.

The 2021 data set has 2131 rows with 22 columns. The 2022 data set has 2275 rows with the same 22 columns. Each row represents a Division 1 Softball player who played in the 2021 and/or 2022 season.

## Questions

-   With multiple seasons of data, you can investigate the different ways to join the the 2021 and 2022 statistics. (e.g., comparing the results of an inner join vs a full join) This can be done manually using subsets of data (to illustrate the joins with simple examples) or scaled up using the full data

-   With a single season/table, you can practice different data wrangling techniques. e.g., finding the league leaders in different categories
