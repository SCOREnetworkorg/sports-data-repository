title: Submit a Dataset
---

Our overall goal is to provide a collection of useful, real-world datasets from
a variety of application areas that can be used as in-class examples, homework
assignments, or course projects. The repository can always use new datasets, so
we welcome submissions. Datasets should meet a few requirements:

- The data must be publicly shareable. There should not be any licensing
  restrictions that prevent us from sharing it, or any human subjects ethics
  concerns or other limitations. Look for datasets marked as being in the public
  domain or with licenses like the Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license.
- The data should be in a standard, easy-to-use format, like CSV. If you have to
  clean the data from an original form, include the R script you used to clean
  it with your submission.
- There should be good motivation for interesting analyses of the data that
  would be appropriate for a course.
- The data should be of reasonable size. GitHub does not allow files greater
  than 100 MB, and large files can be inconvenient for students. Files larger
  than a few megabytes should be compressed when practical. R (`read.csv()`) and
  Python (`pandas.read_csv()`) can read `.csv.gz` files directly, so gzip
  compression is a good choice for larger files.


## Getting Started

This website is built using the Quarto system and automatically rendered into a
website. To contribute a dataset, you only need to fill out a template file with
the dataset information.

You can get the template in two ways:

1. Copy the [`_dataset-template.qmd` file from our GitHub
   repository](https://github.com/cmustatistics/data-repository/blob/main/_dataset-template.qmd)
   and save it on your computer. Once you're done, you can email us the file and
   the data.
2. Fork [our GitHub
   repository](https://github.com/cmustatistics/data-repository) into your own
   GitHub account and edit it like any other Git repository. Once you're done,
   you can submit a pull request.

## The Dataset Template

The dataset template is a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) file; Quarto
is much like R Markdown and is supported by recent versions of RStudio. Quarto
files can contain R code, just like R Markdown, so your data description can
include graphics and tables generated by R code embedded in the file, if you
think this would be helpful to illustrate important features of the data. As you
fill out the template, you can use RStudio's "Render" button to see a preview of
the finished page.

The template asks for:

- Basic metadata, such as the statistical methods applicable to the data, a
  short title, and your name. (All submissions are credited with the name of the
  submitter.)
- A description of the problem. This should be sufficient to motivate the
  analysis and help students understand the setting.
- A description of the data and the variables. It should be clear what each row
  of data represents and what all variables mean. Units of measure should be
  included whenever possible.
- References to the original source. If the source is an academic paper and the
  data is deposited in a third-party repository (such as Zenodo, Figshare, or
  Dryad), include references to both the paper and the archived dataset. When
  available, include the DOIs of the references.

The template is meant to prevent a common problem with course datasets: they get
passed down from instructor to instructor, and eventually all information about
the original source is lost. The dataset may be presented to students without
context or important details (like units), and the instructor may not be able to
find the original data or references to answer questions about the data.

## Submitting

Once you've filled in the template, you can email the template file, the data,
and any cleaning scripts to the repository editor (currently Alex Reinhart).

Alternately, submit a pull request to [our repository on
GitHub](https://github.com/cmustatistics/data-repository). Save the Qmd with a
meaningful name and place it in one of the top-level category directories (like
`medicine/` or `astronomy/`). Place the data files in `data/`. Double-check that
you've committed everything (and nothing extraneous) and open a pull request as
usual.
