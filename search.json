    "text": "The National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) is the top professional women’s soccer league in the United States. While a team’s record ultimately determines their ranking, goal differential (goals scored - goals conceded) is often a better indicator of a team’s ability. But what aspects of a team’s performance are related to their goal differential? The NWSL records a variety of statistics describing a team’s performance, such as the percentage of time they maintain possession, percentage of shots on target, etc. With this dataset, you can explore variation between teams as well as which statistics are relevant predictor variables of goal differential."

The file should make it clear what a single row of the dataset represents, and clearly describe each of the variables (including units of measure when relevant).\nReferences to the original source of the data. If the source is a code package, then include an appropriate citation with a link to the package. If the source is an academic paper and the data is deposited in a third-party repository (e.g., Figshare), then include references to both the paper and the archived dataset. When available, include the DOIs of the references.\n\nThe template is meant to prevent a common problem with course datasets: they get passed down from instructor to instructor, and eventually all information about the original source is lost. The dataset may be presented to students without context or important details (like units), and the instructor may not be able to find the original data or references to answer questions about the data."

    "text": "After nearly two full seasons due to injury, at the age of 39 Justin Verlander returned for the 2022 season to win the American League Cy Young award and World Series with the Houston Astros. Leading the league in a variety of statistics, Verlander dominated in his starts throughout the season. Pitch selection has played a key role into Verlander’s recent success with the Astros. Verlander throws four types of pitches (using MLB’s abbreviation): fastball (FF), slider (SL), curveball (CB), and changeup (CH). However, pitches are thrown in the context of an at-bat where the ball-strike count starts 0-0, and progresses until either the batter strikes out (reaches three strikes), is walked (reaches four balls), or is either hit-by-pitch or hits the ball in-play. As the count varies, pitchers often decide to favor certain pitches over others, e.g, with three balls (i.e., 3-X counts) the pitcher may favor throwing more accurate fastballs relative to out-of-the-zone offspeed pitches that are favored with two strikes (i.e., X-2 counts)."
