    "text": "After nearly two full seasons due to injury, at the age of 39 Justin Verlander returned for the 2022 season to win the American League Cy Young award and World Series with the Houston Astros. Leading the league in a variety of statistics, Verlander dominated in his starts throughout the season. Pitch selection has played a key role into Verlander’s recent success with the Astros. Verlander throws four types of pitches (using MLB’s abbreviation): fastball (FF), slider (SL), curveball (CB), and changeup (CH). However, pitches are thrown in the context of an at-bat where the ball-strike count starts 0-0, and progresses until either the batter strikes out (reaches three strikes), is walked (reaches four balls), or is either hit-by-pitch or hits the ball in-play. As the count varies, pitchers often decide to favor certain pitches over others, e.g, with three balls (i.e., 3-X counts) the pitcher may favor throwing more accurate fastballs relative to out-of-the-zone offspeed pitches that are favored with two strikes (i.e., X-2 counts)."

Each dataset is supported by a story describing its origin and application, and a set of interesting questions that can be answered using the data. This means:\n\nEvery dataset has context in a scientific field, pop culture, or daily life.\nBeyond context, datasets are interesting. They feature more than just a dozen observations from an antiquated scientific study — many feature thousands of observations of dozens of variables, and answer questions interesting to a wide audience.\nJust like in science, some datasets give null results.\nInstructors can easily build lessons and assignments from the suggested questions.\n\nDatasets are organized by sport on the left, or you can browse a list by statistical methods used."

To contribute a dataset, you only need to fill out a template file with the dataset information.\nYou can get the template in two ways:\n\nCopy the _dataset-template.qmd file from our GitHub repository and save it on your computer. Once you’re done, you can email us the file and the data.\nFork our GitHub repository into your own GitHub account and edit it like any other Git repository. Once you’re done, you can submit a pull request."

    "section": "The Dataset Template",
    "text": "The Dataset Template\nThe dataset template is a Quarto file; Quarto is much like R Markdown and is supported by recent versions of RStudio. Quarto files can contain R code, just like R Markdown, so your data description can include graphics and tables generated by R code embedded in the file, if you think this would be helpful to illustrate important features of the data. As you fill out the template, you can use RStudio’s “Render” button to see a preview of the finished page.\nThe template asks for:\n\nBasic metadata, such as the statistical methods applicable to the data, a short title, and your name. (All submissions are credited with the name of the submitter.)\nA description of the problem. This should be sufficient to motivate the analysis and help students understand the setting.\nA description of the data and the variables. It should be clear what each row of data represents and what all variables mean. Units of measure should be included whenever possible.\nReferences to the original source. If the source is an academic paper and the data is deposited in a third-party repository (such as Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad), include references to both the paper and the archived dataset. When available, include the DOIs of the references.\n\nThe template is meant to prevent a common problem with course datasets: they get passed down from instructor to instructor, and eventually all information about the original source is lost. The dataset may be presented to students without context or important details (like units), and the instructor may not be able to find the original data or references to answer questions about the data."
