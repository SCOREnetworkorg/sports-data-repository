To contribute a dataset, you only need to fill out a template file with the dataset information.\nYou can get the template in two ways:\n\nCopy the _dataset-template.qmd file from our GitHub repository and save it on your computer. Once you’re done, you can email us the file and the data.\nFork our GitHub repository into your own GitHub account and edit it like any other Git repository. Once you’re done, you can submit a pull request."

The template asks for:\n\nBasic metadata to tag the dataset, such as the statistics & data science topic, a short title, and your name. (All submissions are credited with the name of the submitter.)\nA description of the sports question to motivate analysis with the dataset.\nA description of the dataset with documentation about each variable. The file should make it clear what a single row of the dataset represents, and clearly describe each of the variables (including units of measure when relevant).\nReferences to the original source of the data. If the source is a code package, then include an appropriate citation with a link to the package. If the source is an academic paper and the data is deposited in a third-party repository (e.g., Figshare), then include references to both the paper and the archived dataset. When available, include the DOIs of the references.\n\nThe template is meant to prevent a common problem with course datasets: they get passed down from instructor to instructor, and eventually all information about the original source is lost. The dataset may be presented to students without context or important details (like units), and the instructor may not be able to find the original data or references to answer questions about the data."

    "text": "After nearly two full seasons due to injury, at the age of 39 Justin Verlander returned for the 2022 season to win the American League Cy Young award and World Series with the Houston Astros. Leading the league in a variety of statistics, Verlander dominated in his starts throughout the season. Pitch selection has played a key role into Verlander’s recent success with the Astros. Verlander throws four types of pitches (using MLB’s abbreviation): fastball (FF), slider (SL), curveball (CB), and changeup (CH). However, pitches are thrown in the context of an at-bat where the ball-strike count starts 0-0, and progresses until either the batter strikes out (reaches three strikes), is walked (reaches four balls), or is either hit-by-pitch or hits the ball in-play. As the count varies, pitchers often decide to favor certain pitches over others, e.g, with three balls (i.e., 3-X counts) the pitcher may favor throwing more accurate fastballs relative to out-of-the-zone offspeed pitches that are favored with two strikes (i.e., X-2 counts)."
