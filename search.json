Leading the league in a variety of statistics, Verlander dominated in his starts throughout the season. Pitch selection has played a key role into Verlander’s recent success with the Astros. Verlander throws four types of pitches (using MLB’s abbreviation): fastball (FF), slider (SL), curveball (CB), and changeup (CH). However, pitches are thrown in the context of an at-bat where the ball-strike count starts 0-0, and progresses until either the batter strikes out (reaches three strikes), is walked (reaches four balls), or is either hit-by-pitch or hits the ball in-play. As the count varies, pitchers often decide to favor certain pitches over others, e.g, with three balls (i.e., 3-X counts) the pitcher may favor throwing more accurate fastballs relative to out-of-the-zone offspeed pitches that are favored with two strikes (i.e., X-2 counts).",

It’s on a points scale instead of the typically used yards, because not all yards are created equal in American football (10 yard gain on 3rd and 15 is much less valuable than a 2 yard gain on 4th and 1). For offensive stats the higher the EPA the better, but for defensive stats the lower (more negative) the EPA the better. The WPA variables are similar except they are measuring play value in terms of win probability.",

You can get the template file in two ways:\n\nCopy the _dataset-template.qmd file from our GitHub repository and save it on your computer. Once you’re done, you can email us the file and the data (see below for email address).\nFork our GitHub repository into your own GitHub account and edit it like any other Git repository. Once you’re done, you can submit a pull request.\n\n\nDataset template\nThe dataset template is a Quarto file. The template asks for:\n\nBasic metadata to tag the dataset, such as the statistics & data science topic, a short title, and your name. (All submissions are credited with the name of the submitter.)\nA description of the sports question to motivate analysis with the dataset.\nA description of the dataset with documentation about each variable. The file should make it clear what a single row of the dataset represents, and clearly describe each of the variables (including units of measure when relevant).\nReferences to the original source of the data. If the source is a code package, then include an appropriate citation with a link to the package. If the source is an academic paper and the data is deposited in a third-party repository (e.g., Figshare), then include references to both the paper and the archived dataset. When available, include the DOIs of the references.\n\nThe template is meant to prevent a common problem with course datasets: they get passed down from instructor to instructor, and eventually all information about the original source is lost. The dataset may be presented to students without context or important details (like units), and the instructor may not be able to find the original data or references to answer questions about the data.\n\n\nSubmitting template file\nOnce you’ve filled in the template, you can either:\n\nEmail the template file, the data, and any code for preparing the data to the repository editor (currently Ron Yurko: ryurko AT stat DOT cmu DOT edu).\nSubmit a pull request to our repository on GitHub. Save the Qmd with a meaningful name and place it in its relevant sports directory (e.g., baseball/ or tennis/). Place the data files in data/. Place any code to prepare the data in the _prep/ folder, inside another folder with a name matching the submitted dataset. Once you’ve committed all of the necessary files (without anything extraneous) then you can submit a pull request.",

Create a first and last name column and get rid of the short_name column.\n1b. Make gender a factored variable.\n1c. Get rid of country_code, discipline_code, residence_place, residence_country, and url.\n1d. See if you can figure out how to separate the height variable into just meters and convert it into a numeric value.\nExercise 2. Using the example above and the filter function in the dplyr package, lets see which country has the most gold medal winners using medal_type.\nExercise 3. Now try finding which country has the most silver medals using medal_code.\nExercise 4. Finally, figure out what discipline the United States of America received the most medals in.\nExercise 5. Think about how you would go about combining both the athletes and medals data sets and what the differences between different join functions would do.",

    "text": "Data\nThere are three datasets below that are relevant for building RAPM models for player performances during the 2022-2023 NBA regular season. All of the data were collected using the hoopR package in R.\nThe first dataset nba_2223_season_stints.csv contains information about 32,358 unique stints during NBA games in which the same ten players (home and away) were on the court together prior to substitutions taking place. This dataset contains the following columns:\n\nnba_2223_season_stints.csv\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ngame_id\nUnique game ID\n\n\nstint_id\nUnique identifier within a game for a stint for particular combination of home and away lineup (in appearance of order, where 1 is the first stint in the game)\n\n\nhome_lineup\nConcatenated string of the five home player IDs, separated by _\n\n\naway_lineup\nConcatenated string of the five away player IDs, separated by _\n\n\nn_pos\nNumber of possessions (combined for both home and away) during the observed stint\n\n\nhome_points\nNumber of points scored by the home team during the stint\n\n\naway_points\nNumber of points scored by the away team during the stint\n\n\nminutes\nLength of the stint in terms of minutes played\n\n\nmargin\nCommon response for RAPM models defined as: (home_points - away_points) / n_pos * 100\n\n\n\nThe second dataset nba_2223_season_rapm_data.csv.gz is the wide design matrix version of the above dataset. This file contains the same 32,358 unique stints, but replaces the home_lineup and away_lineup columns with 539 columns for the unique players that were observed during the course of the season. If the player was on the court for home team, a 1 is observed in their column. If a player was on the court for the away team, a -1 is observed in their column. Otherwise, if the player was not on the court, a 0 is observed.\nAnd for context, the third dataset nba_2223_player_table.csv contains one row for each of the 539 players in the data with two columns:\n\nnba_2223_player_table.csv\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nplayer_id\nUnique player ID that are the names of the RAPM data columns\n\n\nplayer_name\nFirst and last name for the player",
