    "text": "Ecologists and evolutionary biologists have long investigated links between diversity and geography. For example, as the area of a habitat increases, the number of different species found within it increases—a seemingly obvious finding, but the exact shape of the relationship has been found to relate to the rates of immigration and extinction in the habitat, predator-prey behaviors, and so on.\nA similar relationship would seem likely to exist within a species. A species that lives over a small area might have low genetic diversity, because individuals frequently interbreed and there is little opportunity for some individuals to evolve separately from others. A species that lives over a wide area might have high genetic diversity, both because the varied habitat in which it lives means different individuals experience different natural selection pressures, and because individuals far apart may never be able to interbreed.\nThe exact nature of this relationship could be used to test hypotheses about evolution and natural selection. This dataset comes from a paper that explored the relationship in birds, which have widely varying geographic ranges and hence could be a good group to work with."

    "text": "Data\nThis data includes 387 bird species, along with two measures of their genetic diversity, a measure of the size of their breeding range, their body mass, and whether they are migratory or resident birds. The breeding ranges vary in size from a just few islands in the Seychelles, for the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), to enormous ranges of the Southern Ocean for the grey-headed albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma).\n\nverlander-pitches-2022.csv\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nBird species name\n\n\nFamily\nFamily of birds to which this species belongs\n\n\nHeterozygosity\nA measure of genetic richness. Birds (and most animals) have two copies of each chromosome; expected heterozygosity is the probability that for a randomly selected gene, these two copies will be different versions (alleles) of the gene.\n\n\nAllelic richness\nThe average number of different alleles (versions of a gene) for each gene.\n\n\nBreeding range size\nSize of the spatial range over which this bird breeds, in units of 10,000 square km\n\n\nBody mass\nAverage body mass of the species (grams)\n\n\nLatitude\nMid-point latitude of the species breeding range.

    "section": "Questions",
    "text": "Questions\n\nBody size and latitude are thought to be related to genetic diversity for reasons unrelated to breeding range size. Regress heterozygosity against breeding range size, body mass, and latitude. Examine the shape of the relationship, which is thought not to be linear and suspected to have an asymptote. Does the relationship depend on whether the species are migratory? Compare this to the shape you find using allelic richness instead of heterozygosity as the outcome.\nSpecies in this dataset are grouped into families; by definitions, species within a family are more similar than species in two different families. This may have effects on the assumptions of the regression. What assumptions may be violated, and what effect would this have on your results? (Note that the original paper accounted for this effect by taking into account the species’ phylogenetic trees.)\nFit a hierarchical model to account for this effect, using family to define the hierarchy. How do your results change?"

They feature more than just a dozen observations from an antiquated scientific study — many feature thousands of observations of dozens of variables, and answer questions interesting to a wide audience.\nJust like in science, some datasets give null results.\nInstructors can easily build lessons and assignments from the suggested questions.\n\nDatasets are organized by sport on the left, or you can browse a list by statistical methods used."

    "text": "The Dataset Template\nThe dataset template is a Quarto file; Quarto is much like R Markdown and is supported by recent versions of RStudio. Quarto files can contain R code, just like R Markdown, so your data description can include graphics and tables generated by R code embedded in the file, if you think this would be helpful to illustrate important features of the data. As you fill out the template, you can use RStudio’s “Render” button to see a preview of the finished page.\nThe template asks for:\n\nBasic metadata, such as the statistical methods applicable to the data, a short title, and your name. (All submissions are credited with the name of the submitter.)\nA description of the problem. This should be sufficient to motivate the analysis and help students understand the setting.\nA description of the data and the variables. It should be clear what each row of data represents and what all variables mean. Units of measure should be included whenever possible.\nReferences to the original source. If the source is an academic paper and the data is deposited in a third-party repository (such as Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad), include references to both the paper and the archived dataset. When available, include the DOIs of the references.\n\nThe template is meant to prevent a common problem with course datasets: they get passed down from instructor to instructor, and eventually all information about the original source is lost. The dataset may be presented to students without context or important details (like units), and the instructor may not be able to find the original data or references to answer questions about the data."
