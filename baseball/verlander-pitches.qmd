## Motivation

After nearly two full seasons due to injury, at the age of 39 [Justin Verlander](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/verlaju01.shtml) returned for the 2022 season to win the American League Cy Young award and World Series with the Houston Astros. Leading the league in a variety of statistics, Verlander dominated in his starts throughout the season. Pitch selection has played a key role into [Verlander's recent success with the Astros](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2018/10/13/how-justin-verlander-became-better-pitcher-astros/1628624002/). Verlander throws four types of pitches (using MLB's abbreviation): fastball (FF), slider (SL), curveball (CB), and changeup (CH). However, pitches are thrown in the context of an at-bat where the ball-strike count starts 0-0, and progresses until either the batter strikes out (reaches three strikes), is walked (reaches four balls), or is either hit-by-pitch or hits the ball in-play. As the count varies, pitchers often decide to favor certain pitches over others, e.g, with three balls (i.e., 3-X counts) the pitcher may favor throwing more accurate fastballs relative to out-of-the-zone offspeed pitches that are favored with two strikes (i.e., X-2 counts).
