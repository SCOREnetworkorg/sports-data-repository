## Motivation

The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), organizes and
records a series of events such as the World Cup which exists for all
disciplines of FIS such as Nordic Skiing. World Cup races occur every
weekend between January and March, with events hosted in different
countries. These events consist of multiple different races, held in
different disciplines and distances. Nordic skiing is split up into two
different techniques, classic and skate, all race weekends have a
mixture of skate and classic technique races. The race in this dataset
is a womens' 10k classic race set in Trondheim, Norway. In long distance
pieces like 10ks there is often a lot of discussion about pacing.
Racers' times are recorded at different distance intervals throughout
the course. I think it is interesting to look at how well racers' times
at different distances predict their rank at the end of the race. I
think especially the first time is most interesting to see with regard
to the final rank, to see if the same racers who have top times in the
first distance have good ranks at the end of the race.

### Data Preparation

[init-nordicw10k.qmd](../_prep/NordicW10k/init-nordicw10k.qmd)

## Data

Each row of the dataset represents a skier in the womens' 10k classic
ski race in Trondheim. There are 61 racers in the dataset and 20
variables.

## Questions

1.  Create a simple linear regression model of Time4 predicted by Time1.
    Check the conditions for the model, to assess its variance,
    linearity, and normality.

2.  Find the correlation between Time1 and Rank4. Is there a strong
    correlation and if so, is it positive or negative?

3.  Make a model of Rank4 predicted by Bib. Interpret the coefficient of
    Bib.

4.  Use an ANOVA for means test to decide if there is a considerable
    difference in the mean time for each time interval. First, perform
    the test by constructing a one-way ANOVA model for means by hand.
    Then, check it by running it through R.
