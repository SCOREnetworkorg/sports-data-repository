## Motivation

The motivation for this data analysis is to explore the relationships between swim times, bike times, and run times (in minutes) in order to gain insights into the performance patterns of the athletes. By analyzing these relationships, we can understand the interplay between different segments of the race and potentially identify areas of improvement for athletes.

## Data

The main data set has 489 rows with 17 columns. Each row represents a female who has participated in the Ironman in 2022. Additionally, a subset of 2022 female Canadian participants is available and has 64 rows.

## Questions

-   With the different times and rank variables, you can explore the relationships between them through things like correlation coefficients and linear regression.

-   Other things like finding the best variables at predicting a runner's overall rank in a race and then even a division rank would be easy to model using this data set.
